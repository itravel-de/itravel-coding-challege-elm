# Test challenge
# Itravel's coding challenge for Elm

To run the project correctly you'll need Parcel, you can download it using this command:

### Yarn
```sh
yarn
yarn global add parcel-bundler
```

Once parcel is installed simply cd to the project's folder, and run this command:
```sh
npx parcel index.html
```

That's it!
